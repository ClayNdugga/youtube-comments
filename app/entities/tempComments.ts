I would disagree, Hitler would not be defeated in that time frame without Russia but Stalin is just an unfortunate element for russians and the rest of the world. Have Russia had leadership more akin to the western leadership ( flawed that it was atleast before the war ) i believe Hitler would not have had the succes he had at the start of the war and would lose far quicker. Incompetnce in the russian army was unbeliavable at the start of the war. All the best!',

Guess who in both classes NEVER fucked. He was a woman repellant even back then when all it was was the 12 rules and a weird ass, somehow anti-trans focused speaking tour. Now look at him. \n\nA disgraced shrink with an audience of feeble and voulnerable mfs, which most of them are to no fault of their own no matter what this moron says. And how come hes all about climate change denial now, climate change denial in a quasi intellectual, philosophy-adjacent framework? Because 1, he's weird and resentful as fuck, 2, he's OFFICIALLY a propaganda contractor for Exxon. Look it up, and then never pay him any attention again\n\nOnly Lex has the  ability to be a sucker and walk away unscathed, because if the next guest is less insane, he turns right back.

If The Doc were to write a book that might be added to the bible, what would it say? If he wrote something like that, I would buy it instantly.
